# Getting Started

Embarking on your journey to create plugins for Mynders begins with a few simple steps. This section will guide you through setting up your development environment and preparing everything you need to start crafting your unique plugins. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth start to your plugin development process.

## Introduction to Plugin Development

Before diving into the technical aspects, it's important to understand what makes a great plugin. Mynders plugins should enhance the user's ability to organize and manage their information. Think of plugins as individual tools in a toolbox; each has its purpose, from note-taking and task management to password storage. Your goal as a developer is to create plugins that are intuitive, useful, and seamlessly integrated into the Mynders ecosystem.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To make plugin development as straightforward as possible, we provide a boilerplate setup that includes everything you need to get started. Here are the steps to set up your development environment:

- **Create a New Project**: Navigate to the directory where you want to host your project. Then, create the boilerplate code for your plugin by running the following command in your terminal:

  `npx create-mynders-app@latest`

  This command sets up your project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, establishing a solid foundation for your plugin.

- **Install Dependencies**: Once your project is created, navigate to the root directory of your new project and run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

  `npm install`

  This step ensures that your project has all the necessary libraries and frameworks to develop and test your plugin effectively.

## Running a Development Server

With your environment set up and dependencies installed, you're now ready to start the development server. This server provides a mockup development site that emulates how your plugin will look and function when deployed on Mynders. To start the server, run:

`npm run dev`

This command compiles your project and opens a local development server. You can now access the server through your browser to see how your plugin behaves in a simulated Mynders environment. This is an invaluable tool for iterative development and testing.

## Conclusion

You're now equipped with a fully prepared development environment for creating Mynders plugins. In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into the development process, explore the Mynders API, and learn about deploying your plugin. Remember, the goal is to build something that enhances the Mynders experience for users, so creativity and innovation are your best tools.
